# Hazard

It allows Lazarus and Free Pascal programmers to create and execute automated and algorithmic trading strategies.

Although it can serve other purposes, it is being developed to enable [EƵRA](https://github.com/ezlage/EZRA), the Ezequiel’s Robot for Automated and Algorithmic Trading. In that specific implementation, there are two other related components: [HyperX](https://github.com/ezlage/HyperX), the data communication component; and [xLedger](https://github.com/ezlage/Hazard), the middleware.

This repository has already been initialized, but it will take some time to receive the initial code.

### Dependencies

- At least one [HyperX](https://github.com/ezlage/HyperX) descendant provided with a wrapper and a parser for some API
- [xLedger](https://github.com/ezlage/xLedger)

### Change log and roadmap

Pending. As already mentioned, this repository has already been initialized, but it will take some time to receive the initial code.
